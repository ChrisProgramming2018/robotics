## Deep Learning Project ##

In this project, you will train a deep neural network to identify and track a target in simulation. So-called “follow me” applications like this are key to many fields of robotics and the very same techniques you apply here could be extended to scenarios like advanced cruise control in autonomous vehicles or human-robot collaboration in industry.

## Setup Instructions
**Clone the repository**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning.git
```

**Download the data**

Save the following three files into the data folder of the cloned repository. 

[Training Data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Deep+Learning+Data/Lab/train.zip) 

[Validation Data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Deep+Learning+Data/Lab/validation.zip)

[Sample Evaluation Data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Deep+Learning+Data/Project/sample_evaluation_data.zip)

**Download the QuadSim binary**

To interface your neural net with the QuadSim simulator, you must use a version QuadSim that has been custom tailored for this project. The previous version that you might have used for the Controls lab will not work.

The simulator binary can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning/releases/latest)

**Install Dependencies**

You'll need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks installed to do this project.  The best way to get setup with these if you are not already is to use Anaconda following along with the [RoboND-Python-Starterkit](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Python-StarterKit).

If for some reason you choose not to use Anaconda, you must install the following frameworks and packages on your system:
* Python 3.x
* Tensorflow 1.2.1
* NumPy 1.11
* SciPy 0.17.0
* eventlet 
* Flask
* h5py
* PIL
* python-socketio
* scikit-image
* transforms3d
* PyQt4/Pyqt5
